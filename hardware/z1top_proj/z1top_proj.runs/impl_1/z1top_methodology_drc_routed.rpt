2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-15#1 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM cpu/dmem/mem_reg_0_0 because address width (14) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute "ram_decomp = power" if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#2 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM cpu/dmem/mem_reg_0_1 because address width (14) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute "ram_decomp = power" if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#3 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM cpu/dmem/mem_reg_0_2 because address width (14) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute "ram_decomp = power" if BWWE is desired..
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-15#4 Warning
Byte wide write enable not inferred  
Byte wide write enable (BWWE) is not inferred for Block RAM cpu/dmem/mem_reg_0_3 because address width (14) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute "ram_decomp = power" if BWWE is desired..
